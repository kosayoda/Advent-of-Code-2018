'''
To make sure you didn't miss any, you scan the likely candidate boxes again,
counting the number that have an ID containing exactly two of any letter
and then separately counting those with exactly three of any letter.

You can multiply those two counts together to get a rudimentary checksum
and compare it to what your device predicts.

What is the checksum for your list of box IDs?
