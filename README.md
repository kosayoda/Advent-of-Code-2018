# Advent of Code 2018

> This repository contains code and tests for this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

## About
- Written in Python 3
- Not optimized for either time or space, just my take on the solutions for the puzzles
- Tests are written using pytest, and are based on the examples given on each problem's page

## Notes
- Some scripts use modules outside of the Python Standard Library:

|  Days |Modules|
|-------|-------|
| Day 6 | Numpy |
